        <p>My take on Tic Tac Toe. The game is written in javascript with css
          styling implementing material design. The game currently features a
          togglable Computer Player that will try to win and block wins, and in
          the future will never lose. I was working on writing the game tree for
          a mini-max algorithm before I got sidetracked with other things.</p>

          <h3>Twitch IRC</h3>
        </a>
        <p>Back when I dreamed of being a Twitch streamer, I wanted to write a
          bot that could moderate chat for me. I used Java and the Twitch API,
          first only running messages through the console, and later added a
          full GUI using JavaFX. After that I started working on expanding the
          app to work with any irc server and not just Twitch.</p>
